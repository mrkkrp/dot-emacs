;; Texinfo settings.  Currently I mainly translate Texinfo files into HTML
;; documents, this setup reflects the fact.

;;; Code:

(require 'mk-utils)

(defvar mk-texinfo-html-output-buffer-name "*texinfo-html-output*"
  "Name of buffer where HTML version of Texinfo document is written.")

(defun mk-texinfo-html-standalone (&optional output-buffer-name)
  "Generate standalone HTML version of currently open Texinfo document.

Output goes to OUTPUT-BUFFER-NAME, or, if it's not supplied, to
buffer named by ‘mk-texinfo-html-output-buffer-name’.  Return name
of the buffer."
  (let ((output-buffer-name (or output-buffer-name
                                mk-texinfo-html-output-buffer-name))
        (buffer-file-name (buffer-file-name))

When OUTPUT-BUFFER-NAME is given, insert the output in the buffer
with that name."

(defun mk-texinfo-html-export (&optional output-file)
  "Translate current Texinfo file into an HTML document.

Result file will be named as specified by OUTPUT-FILE argument.
If it's NIL, name of result file will be produced by replacing of
.tex extension with .html extension.  This command is smart
enough to find .css file if it's present in the default directory
and include it in the result document."

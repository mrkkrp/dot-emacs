;; Some pretty things for Emacs Lisp coding.

;;; Code:

(require 'mk-utils)

(setq eldoc-idle-delay 0.1) ; default is way too long

(add-to-list 'mk-search-prefix '(emacs-lisp-mode . "emacs lisp"))

(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook       #'aggressive-indent-mode)
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook       #'eldoc-mode)
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook       #'mk-set-sentence-end-double-space)
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook       #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
(add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)

(provide 'mk-elisp)

;;; Commentary:

;; Some tweaks of Tex/LaTeX mode.  I mainly use LaTeX to create good-looking
;; PDF documents, so my setup is quite narrowly targeted.

;;; Code:

(require 'mk-utils)

(add-to-list 'mk-search-prefix '(latex-mode . "latex"))

(defun mk-pdf-latex-generate (&optional output-dir)
  "Generate PDF document from currently opened LaTeX document.

If given, OUTPUT-DIR specifies directory where all the temporary
and result files a are stored.  If it's not given, new directory
with unique name is used instead.  Return name of PDF file
produced."
  (let* ((output-dir (or output-dir (make-temp-file "pdflatex" t)))
         (buffer-file-name (buffer-file-name))
         (output-pdf (f-join output-dir
                             (f-swap-ext (f-base buffer-file-name)
                                         "pdf"))))
    (if (not buffer-file-name)
        (error "Must be visiting a file")
      (save-window-excursion
        (shell-command
         (concat "pdflatex -output-directory "
                 (shell-quote-argument output-dir)
                 " "
                 (shell-quote-argument buffer-file-name))))
      (message "Written %s" output-pdf)
      output-pdf)))
